<div id="intro"><p>Three years on the Gunn Robotics Team has given me the valuable experience to design and create mechanical devices. I have led a group to build a mechanism that, while attached to a 2x3x5-foot tall robot, could lift it off the ground and ascend up a tenn foot tall pyramid. I have machined pieces for a foam-basketball shooter that has adjustable speeds, angles, and directions using the mill, lathe, band saws, and various hand tools. I operated the robot mechanisms during competition one year and drove the robot the next, carrying our team to victory two years in a row. We hope to continue that streak. If you don't see us recieving the medals, however, look out for our flaming red hair and stop by our completely student-run team!</p></div>
